## Description

So, here I am creating an application about local food throughout Indonesia. This application will display food using Recycler View, whose data is taken from local data, and when the item is clicked, it will display details of the food.
## Features

Feature that i add to this program is based on Dicoding Criteria:

- Show images in List format with at least 10 different items using RecyclerVie.
- Bring up the detail page when one of the items is clicked. 
- Display relevant images and information on the details page. 
- Using ScrollView so that content can still be viewed when the application is rotated.
- Add a Splash Screen
- Can share Items
